            JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages,
            but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js.

            JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although "Java" and "JavaScript" are
            trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming
            languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.

            JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the
            DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running
            the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages,
            owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.
