        <big> HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
            elements,
            which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
            certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize
            words,can
            make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
            HTML5 is the latest specification of the HTML language, and represented a major break with previous markup
            practices. The purpose of the profound changes to the language was to standardize the many new ways in which
            developers were using it, as well as to encourage a single set of best practices with regards to web
            development.
