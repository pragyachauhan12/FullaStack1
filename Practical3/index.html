    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Full stack development refers to the development of both front end and back end portions of an application or
        website.The processes involved in the development of a software application mainly fall into two categories:
        front-end
        development and back-end development. </p>
    <p>Front-end development takes care of the clientâ€™s side of the application; a front-end developer makes sure the
        end product is visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
    <p>Back-end development powers the server-side of the application; a back-end developer is responsible for using the
        programming language to exchange information between the browser and back-end databases</p>
